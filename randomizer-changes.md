# Changes from the Vanilla game to randomizer
## Start
- You start with Hero's tunic, Sailcloth and a beacon. You also have the option to start with Goddess Sword and/or tablets.
- You can skip every cutscene by default, even on Normal Mode
- Loftwing is already rescued and wing ceremony is skipped
- Skyloft can be left immediately
- By default, all pillars and the thunderhead are accessible from the start
- All Goddess Cubes can be hit
- Obtaining a Tablet in Tablet Randomizer automatically opens the corresponding light pillar
- Obtaining Ballad of the Goddess in Closed Thunderhead mode will immediately open it
- The randomizer offers the ability to play on Hero Mode or on Normal Mode. On Normal Mode the skyward strike is weaker, but you take less damage and can get hearts. The logic will change with the option you select: some goddess cubes are assumed obtainable with the Goddess Sword on Hero Mode, but will require True Master Sword on Normal Mode for the longer skyward strike range
- Goddess Walls can be revealed with just Ballad and Harp
## Goal
- The Billboard in the Academy displays the required dungeons (2 by default)
- All of them have to be beaten and the Master Sword has to be obtained to fight the imprisoned to access the past
- Sky Keep has to be beaten in order for the door to the horde to unlock, to finish the game
- If you chose the Skip Sky Keep option, you do not have to beat Sky Keep to unlock the door to the Horde fight
## Skyloft
- The goddess Sword is replaced by a chest and the check can be obtained even if you start with a sword
- The chest on the cliff on the goddess statue has been moved to right side of the entrance to the goddess statue area
- Npc's that used to check for a free slot in the pouch don't do that anymore and always give you their item
- Owlan gives you his item even if you already have a shield
- The size of the Dust pile covering babies rattle has been increased to prevent it being obtained without gust bellows
- The trial is accessible on any layer, even after opening Sky Keep
- To access the Archer minigame you just need Bow
- To access Fledge 5 crystal reward you only need to have access to stamina potions (right now locked behind Beating LMF or the dungeon inside LMF in entrance rando)
- To access Cawlin's Letter check you need to talk to the toilet hand first (which requires Harp)
- To access Pipit/Toilet hand 5 crystals you only need to deliver the Letter to either Karane or toilet hand
- You can talk to Sparrot in his house right away to start the Crystal Ball retrieving quest
- Owlan's Kikwi quest can be started after obtaining the reward from the Kikwi Elder in Faron for having found all the Kikwis
### Sky
- The songs at Isle of Songs have been transformed into Chests, which can be obtained with the corresponding sword upgrade
- The Isle of Songs intro cutscene has been removed
- You can start Party Wheel Crystal Quest from the start by talking to the owner
- The Bug Heaven minigame is accessible from the start (granted that you have the bug net)
- The Lumpy Pumpkin Chandelier can now be bonked down even with Spiral Charge
- All of Kina's sidequest chain can now be done from the start
### Sky Keep
- Beating Sky Keep doesn't let the goddess statue fall back to the surface
- Beating Sky Keep spawns you back at Skyloft to prevent out of logic Faron access for tablet randomizer
## Faron
- Sealed Temple is opened from the Start
- You don't have to talk to impa
- Gorko's Bokoblin fight is skipped
- Gorko's Goddess Wall only requires Ballad and Harp to spawn
- When finishing the Kikwi Quest and talking to the elder, the item is given directly instead of appearing on the elders back
- The layer of faron is 1 by default, and switches to 5 after starting Owlan's Kikwi quest. All important actors have been moved to be on both layers 1 and 5.
- You can go past the Goron in Deep Woods without hitting the Goddess Cube
- To raise the gate of time, the harp is required
- The cutscene where groose lands in faron is skipped, he is directly in sealed temple now
- Kikwi Hermit Yerbal spawns after obtaining Water Dragon Scale
- The sacred water quest is skipped, the waterfall in front of Ancient Cistern is removed
- Many Fi Texts are removed
### Skyview Temple
- Obtaining Water Dragon scale changes Skyview to it's layer 2 state (where you are supposed to get sacred water). This naturally changes a lot of things about the dungeon, such as the enemies you will encounter
- On layer 2, the shortcut boards from the first room are already gone. The Mogmas also don't trigger cutscenes anymore (except the first one)
- On layer 2, one dig spot in the three eye room was removed to prevent it blocking the box when trying to push it
- The key door to the main area of the dungeon needs only one key on both layers, thus removing one small key in the dungeon, to a total of 2
- After opening the Beetle chest, the door out of the miniboss room automatically opens, preventing a softlock without beetle
- Some pots have been added that will give you bombs. This is to help players having to go through Skyview with only Bombs
### Ancient Cistern
- After raising the statue all the way up, it's possible to reset the statues position by talking to the stone tablet next to the boss key hole. This is important in order to be able to reach the whip chest and the basement chest
- The cutscene inside the statue has been removed
## Eldin
- The first Statue is automatically checked
- Various Mogma cutscenes are skipped
- The trial is accessible on layer 1
- The layer will always stay at 1, meaning the key piece spots will still be there, same with the rocks to drain the lava in front of digging mitts cave and the key piece
### Earth Temple
- no noteworthy changes
### Volcano Summit
- The Fire Sanctuary is opened by default. This means you do not need the Water Basin or to complete the Scrapper Escort
### Fire Sanctuary
- The first cutscene with Guld has been removed
- The initial cutscene of the first trapped mogma was removed to prevent a possible softlock when activating it out of order
- A clawshot target was added near the first trapped mogma chest. This is so you can escape from the corner without dying without gust bellows
## Lanayru
- The Mines Entry bird statue is unlocked from the start to make sure the player can always go back
- The cutscene before the first timeshift stone has been removed
- The bokoblins for the hook beetle fight do not disappear even with Hook Beetle in inventory
### Lanayru Mining Facility
- A bomb flower has been added to the map room to prevent softlocks when not being able to hit the timeshift stone through the gate
- The dust pile in front of the door in the gust bellows room was removed to prevent being stuck inside
### Sandsea
- All areas of Sandsea are open from the start (Skipper's Retreat, Shipyard, Pirate Stronghold)
- The door to the Shipyard Construction Bay is opened by default and never locks. This skips doing the rollercoaster before the Moldarach fight, and prevents being softlocked without gust bellows
- Ancient Sea Chart is required to access Sandship. It unlocks the dowsing ability. You cannot get the ship dowsing in Pirate Stronghold anymore
### Sandship
- Sandship never reaches it's `post boss defeated state`, to make all checks still possible if Tentalus is fought early
### Lanayru Gorge/Bokoblin Base/Tadtones
- The Lanayru Gorge, Bokoblin Base and Flooded Faron Woods are currently made inaccessible
