  # Pretend this area is reachable without SoT and instead require it
  # for the exit to SK
  # the reason for this is twofold:
  # - only requiring SoT for the actual exit doesn't trip up the algorithm that
  #   separates progress items from nonprogress
  # - When coming from SK in ER, when it hasn't been opened yet *doesn't* place
  #   you on the platform near the entrance (cause it doesn't exist), so you always need SoT to enter SK
