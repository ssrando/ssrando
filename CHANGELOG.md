# Changelog

## Dev
### Options
- Added bomb throw tricks for Beedle's Shop and Skyview (by NULL)
- Added option to randomize Triforces (by YourAverageLink)
  - Skip Skykeep has been split into two new triforce-related options: Triforce Required & Triforce Shuffle
  - When Triforce Required is enabled, the door to Hylia's Realm will only open if the player has the full Triforce; a confirmation textbox will appear in Hylia's Realm if the Triforce is complete.
    - Disabling Triforce Required acts similarly to the old Skip Sky Keep option; Sky Keep is an unrequired dungeon, and the horde door is always open.
    - Enabling Triforce Required and setting Triforce Shuffle to Vanilla acts like the old Skip Sky Keep OFF option.
  - Triforces act similarly to dungeon keys; they can be vanilla, restricted to Sky Keep, or anywhere.
    - When set to be placed anywhere, Sky Keep counts as an unrequired dungeon (empty if EUD is on).
  - To prevent kicking players out of Sky Keep for having a complete triforce, the game no longer forces you out of Sky Keep once you pick up the third Triforce.
  - The locations originally containing the Triforces are now randomizable checks.
- Added option to randomize objects such as tears and light fruits in trials (by cjs07)
### Changes
- Allow calling Fi underwater and without a sword
- Force english regardless of system language
- Write hints as json in json spoiler log
- Added option to fight multiple Demises at the end of the game
- Added option to allow custom music (by Battlecats59)
- Added even more cutscene skips, plus text patches for clarity (by YourAverageLink)
- - New Hint System (by cjs07)
  - Removed all counter options for hints
  - Added Hint Distributions
    - Distributions can specufy the follwing *new* parameters
      - Maximum hints SotS dungeons
      - Maximum hinted barren dungeons
    - Distributions additionally can do the following
      - Add items to the hintable pool
      - Remove items from the hintable pool
      - Add locations to the always/sometimes pools
      - Remove locations from the always/sometimes pools
  - Reworked the interaction between Goddess Cubes and hints (by YourAverageLink)
    - Goddess chests are now linked to the region their associated cube is in for the purpose of hints
      - For example, a SotS hint that would have previously pointed to the goddess chest next to Isle of Songs would say Mogma Turf is SotS not Thunderhead
      - Additionally, an option has been added for whether or not cube SotS hints should look different (above example would say Eldin Volcano has a SotS cube)
      - Barren region calculation now factors in the goddess cubes in the region; a region with no progress items but a cube that unlocks a progress item is NOT barren
  - Added option to choose between specific locations for item hints or just the general region (by YourAverageLink)
    - Note that the default setting is DISABLED, however previous versions of the randomizer always used the precise locations for item hints (ENABLED).
    - When this option is disabled (which uses general regions), it will follow the same logic for Goddess Cubes 
      - Example: Sword in the Goddess Chest next to Isle of Songs -> Progressive Sword can be found in Mogma Turf
  - New hint types
    - Junk
    - Random
    - Sometimes
    - Goal (by YourAverageLink)
      - Goal hints are a new hint type that may be specified in a hint distribution. They act similar to SotS hints, but they specify a required dungeon boss locked by an item in that region
        - Example: Gust Bellows on Sparring Hall Chest with LMF as a required dungeon = Knight Academy is on the path to Molderach
      - At the moment, goal hints are not compatible with the separate cube sots; they will be hinted like normal goal hints
      - Goal hints inherit the dungeon sots limit and use the same limit.
        - Example: If one goal hint is placed for a dungeon, the sots dungeon limit is 2, and goal hints are ordered before sots in the distribution, only up to one dungeon sots hint may be placed.
      - The fixed count specified in a hint distribution is multiplied by the required dungeon count. For example, a fixed of 1 and 3 required dungeons means 3 goal hints will be placed
      - The order of dungeon boss goals for goal hints is randomized once at the start, and then chosen in sequence to try to ensure one exists for each goal, if possible.
        - Example: If there are 3 required dungeons and 1 fixed goal hint (3 after multiplication by dungeon count, with 0 weight), there will be one goal hint for each of the three goals.
        - Exception: If there are no applicable goal-satisfying items left for a goal (can happen if already always/sometimes hinted, or with low-requirement dungeons like Skyview), the hint will be placed for the next goal in the chain (potentially causing a second goal hint for one of the goals)
    - Some of these hint types existed in prior versions, but users had no control over them
- Changed item hints, that point to a specific location, to use the same hint format as location hints
- Temple of Time is always in post LMF finish state
- Beating Skyview (even if it's in a different dungeon) rescues Machi
- Beating Ancient Cistern (even if it's in a different dungeon) removes the void in the Great Tree
- Added "Main Node" option to Open LMF (by YourAverageLink)
  - When enabled, the fire, water, and lightning nodes will start out as active, but the player still needs to activate the main node (which requires an explosive to reveal the timeshift stone) to raise LMF.
- Barren areas are now less likely to receive random location hints
### Bugfixes

- fix gorko sometimes asking to draw bombs even when you don't have them
